# Assignment Reflection
by Mason Francis

### What were the benefits of using a context free grammar for your task domain?

The benefits of using a context free grammar for this task domain enabled me to guide the user towards specific
choices. If my grammar was not context-free, the user might not end up in the correct location. Not to mention,
as was observed by the professor, if the grammar used in this assignment was not context-free, runtime errors may occur.

### What were the down sides or difficulties of using a context free grammar for your task domain?

The downsides of using a context-free grammar include that there was less flexibility in the user's choices that I made available.
The user can only move in the paths I define, which does not necessarily communicate nuances learned by studying motorcycles or 
being part of the motorcycle community. They are limited only to the information I give them.

### What were the benefits of using a constraint based grading for your task domain?

Benefits of using a constraint based grading system for my task domain include that I can give the user specific feedback in relation
to their choices. It provides me more opportunity to educate the user via the feedback given. 

### What were the down sides or difficulties of using a constraint based grading for your task domain?

The downsides of using a constraint based grading system are pretty much the same as for using a context-free grammar for this task
domain. Less flexibility of direction of learning for the user, and the constraint based system means the questions I have to ask the
user don't communicate much nuance surrounding purchasing buying a motorcycle.
